This project is created as part of dev.to Twilio Challenge 2024.
[Link to Challenge Page](https://dev.to/challenges/twilio)

The project uses Twilio Whatsapp service along with OpenAI ChatGPT model for AI.

The concept of the app is to facilitate communication between patients and doctors.

## Change log
Im need to change the code base from twilio functions to normal express server. This is due to the 10 sec runtime in twilio functions.
There will be lot of file changes as the module imports are different for twilio reusable functions
To refer the code you can checkout this commit: c0797c0
